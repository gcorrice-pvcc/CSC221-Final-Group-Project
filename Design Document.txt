Planned Design:
- Game should have a definitive start and end
- Game should display correct guesses
- Game should only deduct remaining guesses on a valid guess

Planned solution is for the game to begin, prompt the player to begin guessing, and after a guess is made update the display and allow the player to guess again. This will continue until the player either runs out of guesses, or completely guesses the word.
